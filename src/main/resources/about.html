<h4>Important information about this processor:</h4>

<p>
    The processor consists of three different algorithms which have been developed under different contracts.
</p>

<p>
    <b>Regional Algorithm</b><br>
    The Regional algorithm of this processor has been developed as a joint effort between GKSS Research Centre,
    Institute for Coastal Research, and Brockmann Consult, under contract of the
    European Space Agency ESA. Co-investigators in form of sub-contractors are the
    Norwegian Institute for Water Research (NIVA) and the Institute of
    Ocean Sciences (IOS), BC, Canada.<br>
</p>

The algorithms that relate the radiances observed by MERIS to first atmospherically corrected reflectances and then to
water quality parameters were developed by Roland Doerffer (GKSS).<br>
The algorithms are described in:
<ul>
    <li>ATBD for atmospheric correction</li>
    <li>ATBD for bio-optical modules</li>
</ul>
