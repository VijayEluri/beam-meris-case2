    The processor consists of three different algorithms which have been developed under different contracts.
</p>

<h4>Regional Algorithm</h4>

<p>
    The Regional algorithm of this processor has been developed as a joint effort between GKSS Research Centre,
    Institute for Coastal Research, and Brockmann Consult, under contract of the
    European Space Agency ESA. Co-investigators in form of sub-contractors are the
    Norwegian Institute for Water Research (NIVA) and the Institute of
    Ocean Sciences (IOS), BC, Canada.<br>
</p>

<h4>Eutrophic and Boreal Algorithm</h4>

<p>
    These algorithms have been developed as a joint effort between the Helsinki University of Technology (TKK),
    the Finnish Environmental institute (SYKE), the Finnish Meteorological Institute (FMI),
    the Spanish Centre of Studies and Experimentation (CEDEX), EOMAP (Germany), and the German Case2Regional Team
    (Brockmann Consult with support from GKSS Research Centre and Norwegian Institute for Water Research, NIVA),
    under contract of the European Space Agency ESA.<br>
    <b>Boreal algorithm</b> (for lakes typical in boreal forest region): In boreal lakes the absorption by gelbstoff
    can be high. Most of the lakes are oligotrophic, but meso- and eutrophic lakes exist as well.<br>
    <b>Eutrophic algorithm</b>: In eutrophic lakes the optical properties are dominated by phytoplankton.
    Chlorophyll a concentrations can be high.<br>
</p>

<p>
    The algorithms have been validated during the validation phase of lakes project.
    For this validation in situ data from lakes in Finland, Spain and Germany were used.
    Tests have also been performed for two lakes in Africa.
    The results of the validation are presented in the Validation Report.
    Also see the related Validation Protocol.
    The results show that in some cases (e.g. in Finland, where lakes
    typically are surrounded by forest) correction for adjacency effects changes the results significantly.
    Thus, we recommend testing the use of, for example, a processor called ICOL as a preprocessing step.
    ICOL can be downloaded with the Module Manager of BEAM.
    The results of the validation can be downloaded from the Lakes Wiki at <a

</p>

<p> The task of the developed plugin processor is to produce Level 2 data from MERIS Level 1b data for
    regional coastal waters. This includes an algorithm for atmospheric correction and an algorithm to
    derive properties of the water such as the inherent optical properties (IOP's) absorption and
    scattering and the concentrations of total suspended matter (TSM) and chlorophyll from the water
    leaving radiance reflectance spectra (i.e. after atmospheric correction).
</p>

<h4>General</h4>

<p>
    The algorithms that relate the radiances observed by MERIS to first atmospherically corrected
    reflectances and then to water quality constituents were developed by Roland Doerffer (GKSS).
    The algorithms are described in:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>ATBD for atmospheric correction</li>
    <li>ATBD for bio-optical modules</li>
</ul>
