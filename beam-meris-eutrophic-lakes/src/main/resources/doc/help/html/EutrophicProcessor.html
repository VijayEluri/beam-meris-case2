    This processor has been developed as a joint effort between the Helsinki University of Technology (TKK),
    the Finnish Environmental institute (SYKE), the Finnish Meteorological Institute (FMI),
    the Spanish Centre of Studies and Experimentation (CEDEX), EOMAP (Germany), and the German Case2Regional Team
    (Brockmann Consult with support from GKSS Research Centre and Norwegian Institute for Water Research, NIVA),
    under contract of the European Space Agency ESA.
</p>

<p> The task of the developed plugin processor is to produce Level 2 data from MERIS Level 1b data for
    eutrophic lakes water. This includes an algorithm for atmospheric correction and an algorithm to
    derive properties of the water such as the inherent optical properties (IOP's) absorption and
    scattering and the concentrations of total suspended matter (TSM) and chlorophyll from the water
    leaving radiance reflectance spectra (i.e. after atmospheric correction).
