<h4>Important information about this processor:</h4>

<p>
    The processor was developed during an ESA project "Development of MERIS Lake Water Algorithms" (Jan. 2007 - June
    2008, ESRIN Contract No. 20436/06/I-LG).
    The purpose of the processor is to derive information about lake water quality from MERIS data. The current release
    includes two versions:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>Boreal lakes processor (for lakes typical in boreal forest region): In these lakes the absorption by gelbstoff
        can be high. Most of the lakes are oligotrophic, but meso- and eutrophic lakes exist as well.
    </li>
    <li>Eutrophic lakes processor: In these lakes the optical properties are dominated by phytoplankton.
        Chlorophyll a concentrations can be high.
    </li>
</ol>

The related Case 2 Regional processor is also applicable for lakes.

The algorithms that relate the radiances observed by MERIS to first atmospherically corrected
reflectances and then to water quality constituents were developed by Roland Doerffer (GKSS).
The algorithms are described in:

<ul>
    <li>ATBD for atmospheric correction</li>
    <li>ATBD for bio-optical modules</li>
</ul>

Also the help files in the processors contain useful information.

<p>The processors have been validated with in situ data from lakes in Finland, Spain and Germany.
    Tests have also been performed for two lakes in Africa.
    The results of the validation are presented in the Validation Report.
    Also see the related Validation Protocol. The results show that in some cases (e.g. in Finland, where lakes
    typically are surrounded by forest) correction for adjacency effects changes the results significantly.
    Thus, we recommend testing the use of, for example, a processor called ICOL as a preprocessing step.
    ICOL can be downloaded with the Module Manager of BEAM.
