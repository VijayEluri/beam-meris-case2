<h4>Important information about this processor:</h4>

<p>
    This processor has been developed as a joint effort between GKSS Research Centre,Institute for Coastal Research,
    and Brockmann Consult, under contract of the European Space Agency ESA. Co-investigators in form of
    sub-contractors are the Norwegian Institute for Water Research (NIVA) and the Institute of
    Ocean Sciences (IOS), BC, Canada.<br/>
    The task of the developed plugin processor is to produce Level 2 data from MERIS Level 1b data for
    regional coastal waters. This includes an algorithm for atmospheric correction and an algorithm to
    derive properties of the water such as the inherent optical properties (IOP's) absorption and
    scattering and the concentrations of total suspended matter (TSM) and chlorophyll from the water
    leaving radiance reflectance spectra (i.e. after atmospheric correction).
</p>

The algorithms that relate the radiances observed by MERIS to first atmospherically corrected reflectances and then to
water quality parameters were developed by Roland Doerffer (GKSS).<br> 
The algorithms are described in:
<ul>
    <li>ATBD for atmospheric correction </li>
    <li>ATBD for bio-optical modules </li>
</ul>

Also the help files in the processors contain useful information.

<p>The processor has been validated during the validation of the the lakes processors.
    For this validation in situ data from lakes in Finland, Spain and Germany were used.
    Tests have also been performed for two lakes in Africa.
    The results of the validation are presented in the Validation Report.
    Also see the related Validation Protocol.
    The results show that in some cases (e.g. in Finland, where lakes
    typically are surrounded by forest) correction for adjacency effects changes the results significantly.
    Thus, we recommend testing the use of, for example, a processor called ICOL as a preprocessing step.
    ICOL can be downloaded with the Module Manager of BEAM.
